<h1 align="center">Living off The Land Attack: Application IoC Generator</h1>

LoLApp is a Python3 tool designed to generate Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and Detection rules specifically for Remote Access Tools (RATs) used in 'Living off the Land' (LotL) attacks.

### Features

The primary functionality of LoLApp is to enable the generation of IoCs and Detection rules for dual-use tools. It is designed for flexibility, allowing users to easily integrate these outputs into their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems or to update their detection rules according to custom templates.
